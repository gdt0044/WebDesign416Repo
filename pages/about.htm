            <h2>Our History</h2>
            
            <p>The history of immersion learning is technically as old as language itself, but to pinpoint 
                the period of time in which the theory behind it reached its most prominent state, we need 
                look no further than the godfather of the Input Hypthoesis, Stephen Krashen. His theory, introduced in the 1970's, attempted to provide
                the gordian knot of how we learn languages. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In a nutshell, the Input Hypothesis states that we learn languages through comprehensible input, 
                this is by understanding messages through the language. It is not by hearing words in the language and 
                instantly understanding them, but rather by hearing words in the language and understanding the message they
                are conveying. This happens through a variety of elements not explicitly tied to the language, audio and 
                visual demonstrations of what message is being conveyed whilst using the language being the most prominent 
                in the earliest stages. A very simple example is if someone repeated the word "gato" whilst holding up
                a picture of a cat. You may never have heard the word before, but by seeing the image and hearing the word
                you understood the message.

                <img src="images/Kaufmann.jpg" alt="Steve Kaufmann">
                <p>
                    Steve Kaufmann has been learning languages for most of his adult life. Born in 1945, he was raised in Montreal, Canada. In 1962 Steve traveled to Grenoble, France where he studied French as his first foreign language. By the age of 60, Steve had become functionally fluent in nine languages and has since developed some level of conversational ability in 11 more. Steve has always taken an immersion learning approach to language learning, surrounding himself with text and audio in the language and learning to read and understand bit by bit everyday. Whilst he wasn't always aware of it, he has been putting the Input Hypothesis into practice since before it was even developed.

                <h3>Khatzumoto, Vice President</h3>
                <img src="images/Khatz.jpg" alt="Khatzumoto">
                <p>
                    Khatzumoto began his language learning journey in the summer of 2004, with Japanese. By September 2005, he was capable of conducting business, reading technical material and participating in interviews in Japanese. He had become fluent in the language in a period of time that was unheard of for most foreign language learners at the time, especially those of  non-eastern Asian language descent. His approach was simple, spend as much time as possible in the language listening and reading things that you enjoy, and you will learn to understand the language. He developed a website called AJATT, which stands for All Japanese All The Time which was essentially a blog explaining exactly how he accomplished this feat. Today, Khatz works alongside Steve to bring the concept of immersion learning and the input hypothesis to the rest of the world, here at Immersion For All.
