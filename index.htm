            <h2>What Is The Best Way To Learn A Language?</h2>
            <h3>The Classroom Approach</h3>
            <img src="images/classroom.jpg" alt="classroom" class="article-img">
            <p>
                When you take a language learning course, you'll find yourself head first in textbooks, grammar drills,
                speaking drills and much more. The focus will be on what you can produce in your speaking and writing,
                what you can retain in your textbook study and how well you can explain the grammar of the language. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This is really good if you want to study the language, it's not very helpful for learning how to 
                speak it and understand it. The term we'll use to describe that is to "acquire" the language. Studying
                is not how you acquire a language. 
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Immersion Approach</h3>
            <img src="images/immersionapproach.jpg" alt="immersionapproach" class="article-img">
            <p>
                Here at Immersion For All we are focused on teaching you how you can not just learn about languages,
                but actually acquire them. Our method is centered around the input hypothesis, coined by legendary 
                language expert Stephen Krashen. The idea here is to focus on building up your comprehension of the 
                language first through listening and reading, and then utilizing that foundation to develop your writing
                and speaking skills. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The most important part of the immersion approach is comprehensible input. You have to expose yourself
                to media you can understand on some level. It doesn't have to be 100%, in fact that would result in you 
                learning nothing new. It just has to possess elements that result in you picking up the language. The 
                point of this website is teaching you how to do this in the most effective way possible.

                Our goal is to make language learning both fun and efficient. We hope you'll join us.
